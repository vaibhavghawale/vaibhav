What are the different phases of the default life cycle?

aven build life cycle contains diff phases:


1. validate: - in this phase it will verify the project diectory structure is valid or not. and it has pom.xml file is there or not.

2.compile: maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding requied jar files in the classpath.

3.test-compile: if we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

4.test : maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are success and how many fails.

5.package : maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

6.install : that jar file in step 5 will be stored in the localrepo.

7.deploy : maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

**8.clean : here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous build. this phase is an isolated phase.
