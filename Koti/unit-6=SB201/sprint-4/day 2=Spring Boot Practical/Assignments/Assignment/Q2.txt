Q2/- Explain the difference between Spring-MVC and Spring Boot.

Spring Boot:
=============
1.Spring Boot is considered a module of the Spring framework for packaging the   Spring-based application with sensible defaults.
2.Used for building a Spring-powered framework, default configurations are   provided by it.
3.Developers do not need to build the configurations manually.
4.The boilerplate code is avoided, and the dependencies are wrapped together in   a single unit.
5.A deployment descriptor is not required in the case of Spring Boot.
6.It is very efficient to use. The development time is reduced with this   framework, thereby increasing the productivity of engineers.
7.Powerful batch processing is  provided by it.
8.There are four types of presentation layers:  Presentation layer, Business layer, Persistence layer, and the Database layer.
9.Along with dynamic web pages and RESTFUL web services, Spring Boot can also   develop other applications.

Spring MVC:
============
1.Spring MVC is considered to be the model view controller-based web framework under the Spring framework.
2.Used For building web applications, ready-to-use features are provided by it.
3.In Spring MVC, the configurations are required to be built manually. 
4.Each dependency is specified separately by it.
5.A deployment descriptor is required in the case of Spring MVC.
6.In the case of Spring MVC, much more time is required for achieving the same. 
7.Powerful batch processing is not provided by it.
8.There are four components in MVC such as Model, View, Controller, Front Controller, or DispatcherServlet Class.
9.Dynamic web pages and RESTFUL web services are developed using Spring MVC.
