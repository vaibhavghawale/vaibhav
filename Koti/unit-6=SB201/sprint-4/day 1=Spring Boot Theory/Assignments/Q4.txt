Q4/- Explain about the various HTTP request methods and some of the commonly used HTTP response status codes.

HTTP request methods:
=====================
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET :The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

HEAD :The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.

POST :The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

PUT :The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE :The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

CONNECT :The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

OPTIONS :The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

TRACE :The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

PATCH :The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

http status code:
==================

--by default these status code will be set by the server, or as a developer we can
also set our desired status code.

100 -- 199  : information
200 -- 299 : success or OK
300--399 : redirection
400 -499 : incomplete resource / bad request
500-599 : server-error

---these status code will be used by the client to know the status of their request.
