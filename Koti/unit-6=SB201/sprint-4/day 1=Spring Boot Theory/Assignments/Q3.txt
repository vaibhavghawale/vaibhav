Q3/- What is the difference between WebApplication and Web-services?

 Web Service:
=============
1.A web service doesn’t have a user interface.
2.Web services are meant for other applications to be interacted with over the internet.
3.Web services are platform independent as they use open protocols
4.Web services are accessed by HTTP methods – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
5.E.g. Google maps API is a web service that can be used by websites to display Maps by passing coordinates to it.


WebApplication:
===============
1.A website has a user interface or GUI.
2.Websites are meant for use by humans.
3.Websites are cross-platform as they require tweaking to operate on different browsers, operating systems, etc.
4.Websites are accessed by using their GUI components – buttons, text boxes, forms, etc.
5.E.g. ArtOfTesting.com is a website that has a collection of related web pages containing tutorials.
