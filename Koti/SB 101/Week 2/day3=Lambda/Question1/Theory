Q1.Write down some predefined Functional interfaces in the java library at least 4
  interfaces, with their methods.
  
Since Java SE 1.8 onwards, there are many interfaces that are converted into functional interface.
All these interfaces are annotated with @FunctionalInterface. These interfaces are as follows. 

1.Runnable –> This interface only contains the run() method.
2.Comparable –> This interface only contains the compareTo() method.
3.ActionListener –> This interface only contains the actionPerformed() method.
4.Callable –> This interface only contains the call() method.

Java SE 8 included four main kinds of functional interfaces which can be applied in multiple situations. 
These are:

1.Consumer
2.Predicate
3.Function 
4.Supplier
Amidst the previous four interfaces, the first three interfaces,i.e., 
Consumer, Predicate, and Function, likewise have additions that are provided beneath – 
1.Consumer -> Bi-Consumer
2.Predicate -> Bi-Predicate
3.Function -> Bi-Function, Unary Operator, Binary Operator
