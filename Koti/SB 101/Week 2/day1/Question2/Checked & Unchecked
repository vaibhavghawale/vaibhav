examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.


Unchecked exceptions:
 1.Unchecked Exceptions occur at the runtime of the program.
 2.These are also known as Runtime Exceptions.
 3. It is not a requirement to handle or catch them at compile time.
 4.the classes which are the direct child of RuntimeException including the RuntimeException class 
 is known as unchecked exception.

 4.System Exception
 5.Missing Resource Exception
 6.No Such Element Exception
 7.Undeclared Throwable Exception
 8.Empty Stack Exception
 
 
Checked Exceptions:
  1.Checked Exceptions occur at the compile time of the program.
  2.These exceptions should be either caught or handled during compile time.
  3.If we do not catch or handle them then the compiler will throw a compilation error. 
  4.the classes which are direct child of the Exception class (except RuntimeException class)
    is known as checked exception class (including Exception class also)
 
Examples of Checked Exceptions:
 1.No Such Field Exception
 2.File Not Found Exception
