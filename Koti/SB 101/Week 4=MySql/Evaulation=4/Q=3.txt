Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to establish these relationships among tables with examples.


There are 3 relationships exist among tables in the Database.

 1.One to One relationship:
    We achieve One to One relationship by taking foreign key and that foreign key is unique.
  
  Example:create table Student(
    -> roll int primary key,
    -> name varchar(12) not null,
    -> address varchar(12) not null,
    -> mobile varchar(10) not null
    -> );

   create table db(did int primary key, personid int unique,foreign key (personid) references Student(roll));
 
 2. One to Many relationship: 
       We achieve One to Many relationship by taking primary key of one table that makes the foreign key of another table .
  
  Example:create table Dept( did int primary key,dname varchar(20));
          create table Emp(eid int,Deptid int, foreign key (Deptid) refer Dept(did));

3. Many to Many relationship
      We achieve Many to Many relationship by by creating third table to connect first and second table.
  
Example:
mysql> create table Student(
    -> roll int primary key,
    -> name varchar(12) not null,
    -> address varchar(12) not null,
    -> mobile varchar(10) not null
    -> );


mysql> create table Course(
    -> cid int primary key,
    -> cname varchar(12) not null,
    -> fee int not null,
    -> duration varchar(12) not null
    -> );


mysql> create table Student_Course(
    -> roll int ,
    -> cid int ,
    -> foreign key (roll) references student(roll),
    -> foreign key (cid) references course(cid)
    -> );
